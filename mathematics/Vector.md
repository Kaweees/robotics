- A vector $\vec{v}$ is a quantity with both magnitude and direction, typically represented as an ordered list of numbers $(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)$ that specify its components along different dimensions.

A column vector is simply a vertical array of numbers, typically written as $\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \ x_2 \ \vdots \ x_n \end{pmatrix}$, that can be thought of as representing a point or direction in n-dimensional space.

X = \begin{bmatrix}
k_1 \\
k_2 \\
\vdots \\
k_n
\end{bmatrix}
