- The gradient $\nabla f(x)$ of a [multivariate function](Multivariate%20Function) $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is the vector in which each component is the [Partial Derivative](Partial%20Derivative.md) of $f$ with respect to that component:
$$
\nabla f(x) = \left(\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_n}\right)
$$
