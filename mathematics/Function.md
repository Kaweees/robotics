- A **function** $f$ is a mapping between two sets $X$ and $Y$, such that for each element $x \in X$, there is exactly one element $y \in Y$ such that $f(x) = y$.
$$
f: X \to Y
$$
where:
- $X \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is the **domain** of the function
- $Y \in \mathbb{R}^M$ is the **codomain** of the function
