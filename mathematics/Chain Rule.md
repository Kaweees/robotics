- The **chain rule** is a rule in calculus for finding the [derivative](Derivative) of a composition of [functions](Function.md).

If a function $f$ is composed with another function $g$:
$$
h(x) = f \circ g  = f(g(x))
$$
The chain rule states that the derivative of $h$ is given by:
$$
h'(x) = (f' \circ g) \cdot g' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$
