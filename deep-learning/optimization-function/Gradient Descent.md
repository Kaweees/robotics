- **Gradient descent** is an [optimization algorithm](Optimization.md) that minimizes a function based on iterative steps in the direction of steepest descent, which is the opposite direction of the gradient,


- A **neuron (aka perceptron)** $a$ is a generalization of a [linear classifier](Linear%20Classifier.md), incorporating a nonlinear activation function.

- Gradient descent minimizes a function based on iterative steps in the direction
of steepest descent, which is the opposite direction of the gradient,
