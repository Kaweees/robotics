- **Forward Propagation** $ f(x) = a^{(L)} $ is the process of computing the output of a [feedforward neural network](Neural%20Network.md) for a given input $x$.


 neural networks

Forward propagation is the process in a neural network where the input data is passed through the network's layers to generate an output. It involves the following steps
