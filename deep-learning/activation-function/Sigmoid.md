- The **sigmoid function** $\sigma$ is an [activation function](Activation%20Function.md) that maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1.
$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$
The sigmoid function is a smooth, S-shaped curve that maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1. It is a popular activation function for binary classification problems, where the output is a probability between 0 and 1.
